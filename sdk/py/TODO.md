# Dev plan for the python sdk

 - [x] create separate requirements.txt (or equivalent) for production use vs sdk internal development (already defined in pyproject.toml)

 - [x] reevaluate chosen names (i.e. directory_map, Response, Invoke, etc)

 - [x] add status and current step to SwitchboardState schema

 - [x] add retry argument to Call and ParallelCall

 - [ ] add additional libraries to enhance testing (moto, coverage)

 - [ ] address TODO notes throughout SDK

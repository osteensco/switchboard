# Dev plan for the python sdk

 - [ ] create separate requirements.txt (or equivalent) for production use vs sdk internal development (already defined in pyproject.toml)

 - [ ] reevaluate chosen names (i.e. directory_map, Response, Invoke, etc)

 - [ ] add status and current step to SwitchboardState schema

 - [ ] add retry argument to Call and ParallelCall
